### How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
When you're developing a program, it is very important to understand and meet the needs of the user. Creating user stories can help with you achieve this because user stories allow us to understand why those needs are important, whom those needs are important to, what the requirements are for that specific feature. For that reason, I think it's valuable to think about the use case for the product and to speak with users directly if possible.

### How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
In my future development work, I hope to incorporate many of the agile processes I've learned about and used. I plan to utilize the concept of sprints and user stories because breaking a project down into manageable chunks can be very valuable in helping to stay focused on something of managable scope and not get overwhelmed by the size or complexity of the overall project. When I work on a team in the future, scrum events would also be beneficial to not only me but the other members of the team. 

### What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
In software development, being a good team members means you should: communicate effectively with others, ask for help when needed, and be curious about learning new things.
